# What is this repository?

This repository contains the solution of the below problem 


## Problem:

Given an array arr[], count number of pairs arr[i], arr[j] such that arr[i] + arr[j] is maximum and i < j.



For Example:


Input  : arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2}



Output : 3



Explanation: The maximum possible pair
sum where i is less than j is  4, which is given 
by 3 pairs, so the answer is 3
the pairs are (2, 2), (2, 2) and (2, 2).
